Xiao Lu, Guanghui Shen, Xuefei Qiao

## Background
Medicare is the federal health insurance program created in 1965 for people ages 65 and over, regardless of income, medical history, or health status. Today, it plays a key role in providing health and financial security to 60 million older people and younger people with disabilities.

Medicare covers many basic health services, including hospital stays, physician services, and prescription drugs. In 2019, Medicare spending accounted for 14 percent of total federal spending and 20 percent of total national health spending. Our team used the linear regression method to find out what factors can affect State Medicare Spending and help states plan their budgets wisely.
